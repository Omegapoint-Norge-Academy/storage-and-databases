# Storage and databases

## Course goal

A thorough understanding of SQL is the key to efficient database management. Even as abstractions for database interactions are developed, it's crucial for graduates to know SQL principles. This gives them in-depth knowledge of data modeling, complex queries, and optimization of database performance. A solid understanding of SQL not only provides better control over the database but also lays a solid foundation for working with various database technologies.

## About this course

This course consists of a theory part and a workshop part.
We need some basic theory to be able to understand database modeling, querying database tables and optimizing the database for performance. After acquiring basic knowledge about the mentioned concepts,
we will put this knowledge into practice when we go through the different tasks in the workshop.
