# Database normalization

Database normalization is a process used in designing a database schema to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity. It involves organizing the fields and tables of a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. The normalization process is typically carried out in several stages, each of which corresponds to a "normal form," a condition that a database must meet to be considered normalized to that level. The most commonly used normal forms are the first three, though more advanced forms exist (up to the sixth normal form).

## First Normal Form (1NF)

- **Rule**: Each table cell must contain a single value, and each record must be unique.
- **Purpose**: To eliminate repeating groups and ensure that there is a primary key.

## Second Normal Form (2NF)

- **Rule**: Meet all the requirements of the first normal form and remove subsets of data that apply to multiple rows to separate tables, creating relationships between these tables and their predecessors through the use of foreign keys.
- **Purpose**: To eliminate redundant data; for example, storing the same data in more than one table.

## Third Normal Form (3NF)

- **Rule**: Meet all the requirements of the second normal form and ensure that all non-primary-key columns are dependent on the primary key.
- **Purpose**: To eliminate columns that do not depend on the primary key, ensuring that all non-key columns are only dependent on the primary key.

## Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

- A slightly stronger version of the third normal form:
- **Rule**: For any dependency A â†’ B, A should be a super key (i.e., A uniquely identifies each row in the table).
- **Purpose**: To address some of the anomalies that are not handled by 3NF.

## Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

- **Rule**: Meet all the requirements of the third normal form and ensure that multi-valued dependencies are also considered.
- **Purpose**: To handle tables that might contain two or more independent multi-valued facts about an entity.

## Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

- **Rule**: Meet all the requirements of the fourth normal form and ensure that every join dependency in the table is a consequence of the candidate keys of the table.
- **Purpose**: To ensure that the database does not have any join dependency anomalies.

## Sixth Normal Form (6NF)

- **Rule**: Proposed for databases that need to accommodate temporal data (i.e., data where the values change over time and history needs to be tracked).
- **Purpose**: To handle temporal data requirements effectively.

Normalization is a balance between optimizing data storage and access speed. Over-normalization can lead to complex joins that might slow down data retrieval, whereas under-normalization can cause data redundancy and inconsistency. The goal is to design a database that is efficient, maintainable, and scalable, meeting the data integrity and performance requirements of the applications it supports.
