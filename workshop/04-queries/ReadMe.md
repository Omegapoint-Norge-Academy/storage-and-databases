# Part 4: Create SQL queries reports

Without using your favorite AI service ;-), create the following reports:

   1. Get all artists without the primary key column, the calculated age of each artist,
   sorted by last name and then by first name
   2. Create a query that gets all the concerts that the artists have held/participated in
   3. Get a report of the 10 latest concerts for a specific concert venue (VenueId).
   The report should display the name of the venue, the title of the concert and the
   date (not the time) of the concert ordered by the start time of the concert.
   4. Get all songs for a specific concert (ConcertId) sorted by the length of the songs.
   In the report, we want to display:
      1. The title of the concert
      2. The title of the song
      3. The length of the song in minutes and seconds (Ex. '04:21')
   5. Get all songs for a specific concert (ConcertId) that are performed by at least two artists
