# Part 4: Create SQL queries reports

Without using your favorite AI service ;-), create the following reports:

   1. Get all artists without the primary key column, the calculated age of of each artist, sorted by last name then by first name
   2. Create a query that gets all the concerts that the artists has held/paricipated in
   3. Get a report of the 10 latest concerts for a spesific concert venue (VenueId). The report should display the name of the venue, the title of the consert and the date (not the time) of the concert ordered by the start time of the concerts.
   4. Get all songs for a spesific concert (ConcertId) sorted by the length of the songs. In the report we want to display:
      1. The title of the concert
      2. The title of the song
      3. The lenght of the song in minutes and seconds (Ex. '04:21')
   5. Get all songs for a spesific concert (ConcertId) that are performed by at least two artists
